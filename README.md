<h1> Instagram Automation Tool</h1>
This is Task 1 of Python Projects in 20Â°C Monsoon Internship Program provided by The Intern Academy.


<br>There are many social platforms where one can share their posts and view others posts. A user used to perform some common activities like liking, sharing and commenting on a post or following some other users. But sometimes, it becomes boring and repetitive so we made a project on python through which you can automate these processes.<br>
So, we have created a tool that performs all the basics functions automatically called 'Instagram Automation Tool'. The bot is created using python, selenium, chrome webdriver and tkinter for UI.
